# Marching Cubes

WIP. Implementation of the marching cubes algorithm to visualise scalar fields. Specifically to to make animations of metaball fluids. Implemented using Unity3D.

**Currently implemented:**

- Interpolated 3D marching cubes for visualising scalar fields (CPU).

**To do:**

- Fix normals to improve shading.
- Convert to use compute shaders to speed up the algorithm.
